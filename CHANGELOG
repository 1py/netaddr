Release: 0.4
Date: 7th Aug 2008

Major changes since 0.3.x
-------------------------

- all general Exception raising has been replaced with more specific 
  exceptions such as TypeError and ValueError and with the addition of two 
  custom exception classes, AddrFormatError and AddrConversionError.

- The IP class now accepts a subnet prefix. It is *NOT* strict about non-zero
  bits to the right of implied subnet mask, unlike the CIDR class (see below).

- The CIDR class is now completely strict about non-zero bits to the right of 
  the implied subnet netmask and raises a ValueError if they exist, with a 
  handy hint as to the correct CIDR to be used based on the supplied subnet 
  prefix.

- The CIDR class now also supports abbreviated CIDR ranges and uses older
  classful network address rules to decided on a subnet prefix if one is not
  explicitly provided. Supported forms now include 10, 10/8 and 192.168/16.
  Currently only supports these options for IPv4 CIDR address ranges.

- __repr__() methods have been defined for all classes in the netaddr module 
  producing executable Python statements that can be used to re-create the
  state of any object.

- CIDR and Wildcard classes now have methods that support conversions between 
  these two aggregate types :-
  	
  	* CIDR -> Wildcard
  	* Wildcard -> CIDR
  	
Housekeeping Changes
--------------------

- massive docstring review and tidy up with the inclusino of epydoc specific 
  syntax to spruce up auto-generated API documentation.

- Thorough review of code using pylint.

- netaddr module now has the special __version__ variable defined which is 
  also referenced by setup.py.

- Some minor changes to setup.py and MANIFEST.in.

- constants and custom Exception classes have been moved to __init__.py from
  strategy.py
  
- An import * friendly __all__ has been defined for the netaddr namespace
  which should remove the need to delve too much into the address and strategy
  submodules.
  
- fixed a number of line-ending issues in several files.
