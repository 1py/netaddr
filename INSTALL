INSTALLATION
------------

Extract the release tarball or zip file to a sensible location on your hard
disk.

Then, you currently have 2 choices until I can get around to creating a 
setup.py script and/or .egg package :-

1) Copy the netaddr folder to the lib/site-packages directory of your Python 
distribution

2) Add the path of the netaddr folder that you extracted to your PYTHONPATH 
environment variable.
