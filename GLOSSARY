I thought this would be handy for those not familiar with some of the terms
in this module.

EUI - Extended Unique Identifier

	A set of IEEE standards to represent unique addresses containing additional
	organisational information. This module support EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses
	that are common used. The EUI-48 standard can be used to represent link 
	layer addresses more commonly known as MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.
