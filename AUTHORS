netaddr is a project released under the BSD license to the Python community
in early 2008 by :-

	David P. D. Moss <drkjam AT gmail DOT com>

It is great to see something that started out as merely "itch scratching"
turning into a useful library used by so many others out there.

A very special thanks go out to :-

	- James William Pye <jwp AT gmail DOT com>
	
	- Duncan McGreggor <duncan DOT mcgreggor AT gmail DOT com> 

whose early adoption, encouragement, suggestions and support have helped spur 
on refinements to some early rough edges and helped to make netaddr a much 
better and more user-friendly library.

A big thanks to Linux distro packagers/maintainers :-

Fedora

	- John Eckersberg <john DOT eckersberg AT gmail DOT com>

Debian and Ubuntu

	- Vincent Bernat <bernat AT debian.org>

Thanks also go to :-

	- Sebastien Douche <sdouche AT gmail DOT com>

	- Everyone on the netaddr mailing list for helping to test releases and
	  suggest improvements.

	- All those who've raised tickets in the issues tracker and made comments
	  on the code hosting site.

A note of attribution and thanks for recipe 18.11 "Formatting Integers as 
Binary Strings" from :-

	Python Cookbook 2d ed.
	by Alex Martelli, Anna Martelli Ravenscroft and David Ascher

And finally, to Guido van Rossum for giving us Python.
